spring boot doesnt have any layout to work with
the best practice we can emulate are discussed here

if you use ecipse to rn yor configuration file , your java class will be under com.filename.demo
it is a good practice to have your other package in that format

let assume you want to create abc package
it will be created like this comm.filename.abc
then you can add class,interface etc under it, 

if you are using intelliJ it configure it the same way too
