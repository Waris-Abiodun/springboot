Choosing a build system, springboot recommend mavenor gradle as thy provide good support for dependcy management
you dont need to provide a versionof dependecies in th build configration file, springboot automatically configurs depedenes base on the versin release
when you upgrade spring boot version , dependencies also will upgrade automatically

if you use start.spring.io you dont have to worried about this
>>>For maven
yo should specify the version number for spring boot parent starter dependecy only, for others it is not neccesary

>>>For Gradle
We can import the Spring Boot Starters dependencies directly into build.gradle file. We
do not need Spring Boot start Parent dependency like Maven for Gradle
also the spring version will automatically configure, no need to specify the version
