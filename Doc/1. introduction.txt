springboot providesa good platform for java developers to develop a tsnadalone production -grade spring appilication tha you can just run
springboot is a good choic cause of scalability i.e the size doesnt affect its functionality as the business grows its adjust automatically to it
it reduces develelopment time and run applications independently compard to beforre that you will need to get many dependecies , steps and framework to run yor application after you code
it provides a powerful batch processing and manges REST endpoints, REpresentational State Transfer allows user to get,update, dele and create resources

>>>>>How it Works
 the entry point is the class you use the annotation @SpringBootApplication and the main method
spring boot use @ComponentSCan annotation to scan all the components
adding @EnableAutoConfiguration or @SpringBootApplication annotation to your main class fie allows springboot ti automatically configures your spring application based on JAR dependencies added in the project
using @springbootapplication do not need to add @EnableAutoConfiguration, @ComponentScan and @SpringBootConfiguration as it include all other annotation

@ComponentScan scan the components added in the projects, it scan all the beans and package declaration when the application initializes

It can be used for Spring security[Spring Boot Starter Security dependecy]
it can be used for REST endpoints[Spring  Boot Starter web dependency]
it can be used to create web application[Spring boot Starter ThymeLeaf dependency]
